## Controlling LEDs using Arduino and HTTP

In this assignment,  an ESP32 board was used to control the state of three LEDs by making a GET request to a server and using the response to set the LED states.



### User Input

You are allowed to change the desired state of each of the three LEDs by using the [tester site](https://ecse-three-led.netlify.app/). The site determines the behaviour of your circuit by toggling each of the three light switches.
